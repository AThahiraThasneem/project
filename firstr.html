        Recipe: Red Forest Cake<br><br>

Preparation Time: 2 hours<br>
Cooking Time: 30 minutes<br>
Servings: 10-12 slices<br><br>

Ingredients:<br><br>
- 2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
- 1 ½ cups granulated sugar<br>
- ¾ cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
- 2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
- 1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
- ½ teaspoon salt<br>
- ¾ cup buttermilk<br>
- ½ cup vegetable oil<br>
- 2 large eggs<br>
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
- 1 cup boiling water<br><br>

For the filling and frosting:<br><br>
- 2 cups heavy cream<br>
- ¼ cup powdered sugar<br>
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
- 2 cups fresh or frozen cherries, pitted and halved<br>
- ½ cup cherry jam<br><br>

For the garnish:<br><br>
- Fresh cherries, for decoration<br>
- Chocolate shavings, for decoration<br><br>

Instructions:<br><br>
1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.<br>
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk together until well combined.<br>
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the buttermilk, vegetable oil, eggs, and vanilla extract. Gradually add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, mixing well after each addition.<br>
4. Slowly pour in the boiling water while continuing to mix. The batter will be thin, but that's normal. Stir until the batter is smooth.<br>
5. Divide the batter equally between the prepared cake pans. Smooth the tops with a spatula.<br>
6. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.<br>
7. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>
8. In the meantime, prepare the filling and frosting. In a large mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract until soft peaks form.<br>
9. Reserve about 1 cup of whipped cream for frosting the cake, and set it aside in the refrigerator.<br>
10. Gently fold in the cherry jam into the remaining whipped cream until well combined. This will be the filling for the cake.<br>
11. Once the cakes have cooled, slice each cake horizontally into two equal layers. You will have a total of four layers.<br>
12. Place one layer on a serving plate and spread a thin layer of cherry whipped cream filling on top. Arrange a layer of cherry halves on top of the filling.<br>
13. Repeat step 12 with the remaining layers, placing a layer of cake, then cherry filling, then cherries, until you reach the final layer.<br>
14. Take the reserved whipped cream out of the refrigerator and frost the top and sides of the cake.<br>
15. Decorate the top of the cake with fresh cherries and chocolate shavings.<br>
16. Refrigerate the Red Forest Cake for at least 1 hour to allow the flavors to meld. Serve chilled and enjoy!<br><br>

Note: You can also add a drizzle of chocolate ganache between the layers for added richness and depth of flavor.
