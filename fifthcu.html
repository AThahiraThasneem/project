        Here's a recipe to make traditional custard tarts:<br><br>

**Ingredients:**<br><br>

**For the Tart Crust:**<br>
- 1 sheet of frozen puff pastry, thawed (or make your own pastry)<br><br>

**For the Custard Filling:**<br>
- 2 cups whole milk<br>
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 4 large egg yolks<br>
- 1/4 cup cornstarch<br>
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
- Ground nutmeg or cinnamon (optional, for dusting)<br><br>
**Instructions:**<br>

**1. Preheat the Oven:**<br>

   a. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).<br>

**2. Prepare the Tart Crust:**<br>

   a. Roll out the thawed puff pastry sheet on a lightly floured surface to a thickness of about 1/8 inch. You can also make your own pastry crust if you prefer.<br>

   b. Using a round cutter or a glass that's slightly larger than your tart molds, cut out circles of pastry to line the tart molds.<br>

   c. Carefully line the tart molds with the pastry circles, pressing them gently into the molds. Trim any excess pastry.<br>

   d. Prick the bottom of the pastry with a fork to prevent it from puffing up too much during baking.<br><br>

**3. Prepare the Custard Filling:**<br><br>

   a. In a saucepan, heat the milk until it's almost boiling. Remove it from the heat and set it aside.<br>

   b. In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch until well combined.<br>

   c. Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly.<br>

   d. Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and comes to a boil.<br>

   e. Once the custard is thickened, remove it from the heat and stir in the vanilla extract.<br><br>

**4. Fill the Tart Shells:**<br><br>

   a. Carefully pour the hot custard into the prepared tart shells.<br><br>

**5. Bake:**<br><br>

   a. Place the filled tart shells in the preheated oven and bake for about 20-25 minutes, or until the custard is set and the pastry is golden brown.<br><br>

**6. Cool and Serve:**<br><br>

   a. Allow the custard tarts to cool in the tart molds for a few minutes. You can then remove them from the molds and transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>

   b. Once they have cooled, you can dust the tops with ground nutmeg or cinnamon if you like.<br><br>

**7. Serve:**<br><br>

   a. Custard tarts are best served at room temperature.<br><br>

Enjoy your homemade custard tarts, which are wonderfully creamy and full of flavor. They make for a delightful dessert or sweet treat to accompany coffee or tea.<br>
