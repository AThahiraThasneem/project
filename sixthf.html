 <p>Ingredients:

    -1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter<br>
   -2 cups granulated sugar<br>
    -4 large eggs<br>
    -1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
    -1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
    -2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
    -1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
    -1 cup chopped walnuts<br>
    -1 cup semisweet chocolate chips (optional, for extra fudginess)<br>
    Instructions:<br>
    
    1.Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x13-inch (23x33 cm) baking pan and line it with parchment paper, leaving some overhang for easy removal.<br>
    
    2.Melt the Butter: In a microwave-safe bowl or using a double boiler, melt the butter. Allow it to cool slightly.<br>
    
    3.Mix the Wet Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine the melted butter and granulated sugar. Stir until well combined. Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and mix until the batter is smooth.<br>
    
    4.Combine Dry Ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt. Gradually add this dry mixture to the wet mixture and stir until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.<br>
    
    5.Add Walnuts and Chocolate Chips: Gently fold in the chopped walnuts and chocolate chips (if you're using them). This will add texture and extra fudginess to your brownies.<br>
    
    6.Bake: Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick or a cake tester inserted into the center comes out with a few moist crumbs (but not wet batter). Baking times may vary, so keep a close eye on them.<br>
    
    7.Cool and Cut: Remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for a while. Then, using the parchment paper overhang, lift the brownies out of the pan and place them on a wire rack to cool completely. This helps them set and develop that fudgy texture.<br>
    
    8.Slice and Serve: Once cooled, cut the brownies into squares or rectangles. Enjoy your homemade fudge walnut brownies!<br>
    
    9.You can store these brownies in an airtight container at room temperature for a few days. They are delicious on their own or with a scoop of ice cream. Feel free to adjust the recipe to your liking, and if you're a fan of extra fudginess, you can reduce the baking time slightly.<br>
