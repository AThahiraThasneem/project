       Here's a recipe for making a delicious chocolate tart with a chocolate ganache filling:<br>

**Ingredients:**<br>

**For the Tart Crust:**<br>
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
- 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cubed<br>
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 1 large egg yolk<br>
- 2 tablespoons ice-cold water<br>

**For the Chocolate Ganache Filling:**<br>
- 8 ounces (about 1 1/3 cups) semisweet or bittersweet chocolate, finely chopped<br>
- 1 cup heavy cream<br>
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter<br>
- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br>

**Instructions:**<br>

**1. Prepare the Tart Crust:**<br>

   a. In a food processor, combine the flour, unsweetened cocoa powder, and granulated sugar. Pulse a few times to mix.<br>

   b. Add the cold, cubed butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br>

   c. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and ice-cold water. Add this to the food processor and pulse until the dough comes together. If needed, add a little more water.<br>

   d. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.<br>

**2. Preheat the Oven:**<br>

   a. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).<br>

**3. Roll Out and Shape the Tart Crust:**<br>

   a. On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a circle, about 12 inches in diameter.<br>

   b. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9 or 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the pan and trim any excess. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking.<br>

**4. Bake the Crust:**<br>

   a. Line the tart crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights, dried beans, or rice.<br>

   b. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment paper and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is set and slightly dry. Let it cool completely.<br>

**5. Prepare the Chocolate Ganache Filling:**<br>

   a. Place the finely chopped chocolate in a heatproof bowl.<br>

   b. In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream and butter until it just starts to boil. Pour the hot cream mixture over the chopped chocolate and let it sit for a minute.<br>

   c. Stir the chocolate and cream together until the mixture is smooth and the chocolate is completely melted. Stir in the vanilla extract.<br>

**6. Fill the Tart:**<br>

   a. Pour the chocolate ganache into the cooled tart crust and spread it evenly.<br>

**7. Chill:**<br>

   a. Place the tart in the refrigerator and let it chill for at least 2-3 hours, or until the ganache is set.<br>

**8. Serve:**<br>

   a. Slice and serve your chocolate tart. It's rich and luxurious, making it a perfect dessert for special occasions.<br>

You can garnish your chocolate tart with whipped cream, fresh berries, or a dusting of cocoa powder for an extra touch of elegance. Enjoy your homemade chocolate tart!
