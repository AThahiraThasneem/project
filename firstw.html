        Recipe for White Forest Cake:<br><br>

        Ingredients:<br><br>
        - 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour<br>
        - 2 cups sugar<br>
        - 1 cup milk<br>
        - ½ cup unsalted butter, softened<br>
        - ½ cup vegetable oil<br>
        - 4 large eggs<br>
        - 2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
        - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
        - 1 teaspoon almond extract<br>
        - 1 cup cherry pie filling<br>
        - 1 ½ cups heavy cream<br>
        - ½ cup powdered sugar<br>
        - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
        - 1 cup white chocolate shavings<br><br>
        
        Instructions:<br><br>
        1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans.<br>
        2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.<br>
        3. Add in the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla and almond extract.<br>
        4. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and baking powder.<br>
        5. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the flour mixture, mixing until just combined. Do not overmix.<br>
        6. Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans, smoothing the tops with a spatula.<br>
        7. Bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.<br>
        8. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.<br>
        9. Once the cakes have cooled, place one layer on a serving plate. Spread a generous amount of cherry pie filling evenly over the top.<br>
        10. In a separate bowl, whip the heavy cream until soft peaks form. Gradually add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, continuing to whip until stiff peaks form.<br>
        11. Spread a layer of whipped cream over the cherry pie filling on the first cake layer. Place the second cake layer on top.<br>
        12. Frost the top and sides of the cake with the remaining whipped cream.<br>
        13. Decorate the cake with white chocolate shavings, gently pressing them onto the sides and sprinkling some on top.<br>
        14. Refrigerate the White Forest Cake for at least 2 hours before serving to allow the flavors to meld and the frosting to set.<br>
        15. Slice and serve the delicious White Forest Cake to enjoy the luscious combination of flavors.<br><br>
        
        Note: You can also add additional cherries or cherry syrup between the cake layers for extra cherry flavor.<br>
