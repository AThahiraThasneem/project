**Ingredients:**<br>

**For the Tart Crust:**<br>
- 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cold and cubed<br>
- 1 large egg yolk<br>
- 2 tablespoons ice-cold water<br>

**For the Pastry Cream:**<br>
- 2 cups whole milk<br>
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 4 large egg yolks<br>
- 1/4 cup cornstarch<br>
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>

**For the Fruit Topping:**<br>
- Assorted fresh fruits (e.g., berries, kiwi, peach slices, grapes, etc.)<br>
- Apricot or fruit jelly for glaze<br>

**Instructions:**<br>

**1. Prepare the Tart Crust:**<br>

   a. In a food processor, combine the flour and sugar. Pulse a few times to mix.<br>

   b. Add the cold, cubed butter and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.<br>

   c. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and ice-cold water. Add this to the food processor and pulse until the dough comes together. If needed, add a little more water.<br>

   d. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and shape it into a disk. Wrap it in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.<br>

**2. Preheat the Oven:**<br>

   a. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C)<br>.

**3. Roll Out and Shape the Tart Crust:**<br>

   a. On a floured surface, roll out the chilled dough into a circle, about 12 inches in diameter.<br>

   b. Carefully transfer the rolled-out dough to a 9 or 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Press the dough into the pan and trim any excess. Prick the bottom of the crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking.<br>

**4. Bake the Crust:**<br>

   a. Line the tart crust with parchment paper and fill it with pie weights, dried beans, or rice.<br>

   b. Bake in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Remove the weights and parchment paper and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown. Let it cool completely.<br>

**5. Prepare the Pastry Cream:*<br>*

   a. In a saucepan, heat the milk until it's just about to boil. In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until well combined.<br>

   b. Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking constantly. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until it thickens and comes to a boil.<br>

   c. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.<br>

   d. Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl and cover it with plastic wrap, placing the wrap directly on the surface of the cream to prevent a skin from forming. Let it cool to room temperature.<br>

**6. Assemble the Fruit Tart:*<br>*

   a. Once the tart crust and pastry cream are completely cool, spread the pastry cream evenly over the crust.<br>

   b. Arrange the fresh fruits on top of the pastry cream in a decorative pattern.<br>

**7. Glaze the Fruit:**<br>

   a. Heat apricot or fruit jelly in a small saucepan or microwave until it becomes liquid. Use a pastry brush to glaze the fruit with the melted jelly.<br>

**8. Serve:**<br>

   a. Refrigerate the fruit tart until serving. It's best enjoyed when chilled.<br>

Slice and serve your homemade fruit tart, which is not only delicious but also a work of art. You can get creative with the fruit combinations to make it as colorful and visually appealing as you like. Enjoy!</p></body></html>
