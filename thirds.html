 <p> Here's a basic recipe for making a classic sweet apple strudel:<br><br>

    **Ingredients:**<br><br>
    
    **For the Dough:**<br><br>
    - 2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
    - 1/4 teaspoon salt<br>
    - 1/3 cup vegetable oil<br>
    - 3/4 cup warm water<br><br>
    
    **For the Filling:**<br><br>
    - 4-5 medium-sized apples (e.g., Granny Smith)<br>
    - 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>
    - 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br>
    - 1/2 cup breadcrumbs<br>
    - 1/2 cup finely chopped walnuts or almonds (optional)<br>
    - 1/4 cup melted butter<br><br>
    
    **For Brushing:**<br><br>
    - 1/4 cup melted butter<br><br>
    
    **For Dusting:**<br><br>
    - Powdered sugar<br><br>
    
    **Instructions:**<br><br>
    
    **1. Prepare the Dough:**<br><br>
       a. In a mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt.<br>
       b. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture and add the vegetable oil and warm water.<br>
       c. Mix the ingredients until a dough forms. Knead the dough until it's smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.<br>
       d. Shape the dough into a ball, coat it with a bit of oil, and cover it. Let it rest for at least 30 minutes at room temperature.<br><br>
    
    **2. Prepare the Filling:**<br><br>
       a. Peel, core, and thinly slice the apples.<br>
       b. In a bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, and ground cinnamon. Mix well and let it sit for about 15 minutes to release some of the apple juices.<br>
       c. Drain any excess liquid from the apple mixture.<br>
       d. Mix the breadcrumbs and chopped nuts into the apple mixture.<br><br>
    
    **3. Roll Out the Dough:**<br><br>
       a. Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).<br>
       b. On a well-floured surface, roll out the rested dough into a thin, large rectangle. It should be thin enough that you can almost see through it. You can also use a clean, thin kitchen towel to stretch the dough gently.<br>
    
    **4. Assemble the Strudel:**<br><br>
       a. Brush the rolled-out dough with melted butter.<br>
       b. Spread the apple mixture evenly over the dough, leaving about an inch border on all sides.<br>
       c. Carefully fold in the short sides of the dough, then lift the edge of the dough closest to you and begin to roll it up into a log.<br>
       d. Place the strudel, seam side down, on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Tuck in any loose ends.<br><br>
    
    **5. Brush and Bake:**<br><br>
       a. Brush the top of the strudel with the remaining melted butter.<br>
       b. Bake in the preheated oven for about 35-45 minutes, or until the strudel is golden brown and the apples are tender.<br><br>
    
    **6. Serve:**<br><br>
       a. Let the strudel cool for a few minutes, then dust it with powdered sugar.<br>
       b. Slice and serve warm. It's great on its own or with a dollop of whipped cream or a scoop of vanilla ice cream.<br>
    
    You can also make savory versions of strudel by using ingredients like spinach and feta, cheese and herbs, or any combination of your favorite fillings. The method for assembling the pastry is the same; just adjust the filling to your taste.</p></body></html>
