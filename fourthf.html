        Fruit cobblers are rustic, comforting desserts that are easy to make and can be adapted to your favorite fruits. Here's a basic recipe for a fruit cobbler:<br>

**Ingredients:**<br>

**For the Fruit Filling:**<br>
- 4-5 cups of fresh or frozen fruit (e.g., peaches, berries, apples, cherries, etc.)<br>
- 1/2 to 1 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste depending on fruit sweetness)<br>
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)<br>
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch or tapioca starch (to thicken the filling)<br>

**For the Cobbler Topping:**<br>
- 1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar<br>
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder<br>
- 1/2 teaspoon salt<br>
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted<br>
- 1/2 cup milk<br>

**Instructions:**<br>

**1. Preheat the Oven:**<br>

   - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).<br>

**2. Prepare the Fruit Filling:**<br>

   a. In a large mixing bowl, combine the fruit with sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla extract (if using). Toss well to coat the fruit evenly.<br>

   b. Sprinkle the cornstarch or tapioca starch over the fruit mixture and stir to combine. This will help thicken the fruit juices as the cobbler bakes.<br>

**3. Transfer the Fruit Filling:**<br>

   a. Pour the prepared fruit filling into a 9x13-inch baking dish or a similar-sized ovenproof dish.<br>

**4. Prepare the Cobbler Topping:**<br>

   a. In another mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.<br>

   b. Add the melted butter and milk to the dry ingredients. Stir until just combined; it will form a thick batter.<br>

**5. Add the Cobbler Topping:**<br>

   a. Spoon the cobbler topping over the fruit filling in the baking dish. You can spread it evenly or leave it rustic-looking by dolloping spoonfuls over the fruit.<br>

**6. Bake:**<br>

   a. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 40-50 minutes, or until the cobbler topping is golden brown and the fruit filling is bubbling.<br>

**7. Cool Slightly and Serve:**<br>

   a. Allow the cobbler to cool slightly before serving. It's best enjoyed warm.<br>

**8. Serving:*<br>*

   a. Serve your fruit cobbler as is or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, a dollop of whipped cream, or a drizzle of caramel sauce for extra indulgence.<br>

Feel free to customize your cobbler by mixing and matching fruits or adding spices like cinnamon or nutmeg to the filling. Cobblers are a great way to showcase seasonal fruits and are perfect for casual gatherings and family desserts. Enjoy!<br>
