 <p>Recipe: Black Forest Cake<p>

    Ingredients:<br><br>
    - 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
    - 2 cups granulated sugar<br>
    - 3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder<br>
    - 1 ½ teaspoons baking powder<br>
    - 1 ½ teaspoons baking soda<br>
    - 1 teaspoon salt<br>
    - 2 eggs<br>
    - 1 cup whole milk<br>
    - 1/2 cup vegetable oil<br>
    - 2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
    - 1 cup boiling water<br>
    - 1 can of pitted cherries (14 oz), drained (reserve the juice)<br>
    - 2 cups heavy whipping cream<br>
    - 1/4 cup powdered sugar<br>
    - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br>
    - Shaved dark chocolate, for garnish<br>
    </p>
    
  <p>  Instructions:<br><br>
    1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease two 9-inch round cake pans.<br>
    2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Mix well.<br>
    3. Add eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla extract to the dry ingredients. Beat on medium speed until well combined.<br>
    4. Stir in the boiling water, which will make the batter thin. Mix until the batter is smooth, without any lumps.<br>
    5. Pour the batter evenly into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven for about 30-35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.<br>
    6. Remove the cakes from the oven and let them cool in the pans for 10 minutes. Then, transfer the cakes onto a wire rack and let them cool completely.<br>
    7. In the meantime, prepare the whipped cream by pouring the heavy cream into a mixing bowl. Beat the cream with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Add powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and beat until stiff peaks form. Set aside.<br>
    8. Once the cakes have cooled, level the tops if necessary. Cut each cake in half horizontally to create four layers.<br>
    9. Place one layer of cake on a serving plate. Brush the top with some reserved cherry juice, then spread a layer of whipped cream on top. Scatter some drained cherries over the cream.<br>
    10. Repeat this process with the remaining layers, ending with a layer of whipped cream and cherries on top.<br>
    11. Decorate the sides of the cake with the remaining whipped cream using a spatula or piping bag for a professional finish.<br>
    12. Sprinkle the shaved dark chocolate over the top of the cake as a garnish.<br>
    13. Refrigerate the cake for at least 1 hour, or until ready to serve.<br>
    14. Slice and enjoy your homemade Black Forest Cake!<br><br>
    
    Note: Feel free to add an extra layer of whipped cream and cherries between each cake layer if you'd like a bolder cherry flavor.
