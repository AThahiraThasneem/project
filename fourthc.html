        Making a fruit pie is a delightful way to enjoy seasonal fruits. Here's a basic recipe for a fruit pie, such as an apple or berry pie. You can adapt the filling to your favorite fruits.<br>

**Ingredients:**<br>

**For the Pie Crust:**<br>

- 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
- 1 teaspoon salt<br>
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold and cubed<br>
- 6-8 tablespoons ice-cold water<br><br>

**For the Fruit Filling:**<br>

- 6-8 cups of fresh or frozen fruit (e.g., apples, berries, peaches, etc.)<br>
- 1 cup granulated sugar (adjust to taste depending on fruit sweetness)<br>
- 2 tablespoons cornstarch or tapioca starch<br>
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (adjust to taste)<br>
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter (for dotting)<br><br>

**Instructions:**<br><br>

**1. Prepare the Pie Crust:**<br>

   a. In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the cold, cubed butter.<br>

   b. Use a pastry cutter, fork, or your hands to work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with some pea-sized pieces of butter.<br>

   c. Gradually add the ice-cold water, one tablespoon at a time, and mix just until the dough starts to come together. You may not need all the water.<br>

   d. Divide the dough into two equal portions, shape each into a disk, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.<br>

**2. Prepare the Fruit Filling:**<br>

   a. If using apples or other firm fruits, peel and slice them. If using berries or softer fruits, you can leave them whole or slice them as needed.<br>

   b. In a large bowl, combine the fruit with sugar, cornstarch, ground cinnamon, and lemon juice. Toss well to coat the fruit evenly.<br>

**3. Preheat the Oven:**<br>

   a. Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C).<br>

**4. Roll Out the Pie Crust:**<br>

   a. On a floured surface, roll out one of the pie crust disks into a circle, about 12 inches in diameter. This will be your bottom crust.<br>

**5. Line the Pie Plate:**<br>

   a. Carefully transfer the rolled-out crust to a 9-inch pie plate. Press it gently into the plate, leaving any excess dough hanging over the edges.<br>

**6. Add the Fruit Filling:**<br>

   a. Pour the prepared fruit filling into the pie crust in the pie plate. Dot the filling with small pieces of butter.<br>

**7. Roll Out the Top Crust:**<br>

   a. Roll out the second pie crust disk into a similar-sized circle.<br>

**8. Cover the Pie:**<br>

   a. Place the rolled-out top crust over the fruit filling. Trim any excess overhanging dough, leaving a small border. You can crimp the edges to seal the pie.<br>

   b. Make small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.<br>

**9. Bake:**<br>

   a. Place the pie in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes at 425°F (220°C).<br>

   b. Reduce the oven temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for an additional 35-45 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.<br>

**10. Cool and Serve:**<br>

   a. Allow the pie to cool on a wire rack for at least a couple of hours before slicing. This will allow the filling to set.<br>

Serve your fruit pie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for a delicious, classic dessert. Enjoy!
