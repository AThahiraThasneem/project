 <p>Ingredients:<br>
    -2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br>
    -1 teaspoon baking soda<br>
    -1 teaspoon salt<br>
    -1 cup unsalted butter, softened<br>
    -3/4 cup granulated sugar<br>
    -3/4 cup packed brown sugar<br>
    -2 teaspoons vanilla extract<br>
    -2 large eggs, at room temperature<br>
    -2 cups semisweet chocolate chips<br>
    Instructions:<br>
    1.Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).<br>
    2.In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.<br>
    3.In a large bowl, beat the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla extract until creamy, about 2 minutes.<br>
    4.Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition.<br>
    5.Gradually beat in the flour mixture.<br>
    6.Stir in the chocolate chips.<br>
    7.If time permits, wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours but no more than 72 hours. This allows the dough to “marinate” and makes the cookies thicker, chewier, and more flavorful.<br>
    8.Let the dough sit at room temperature just until it is soft enough to scoop.
    9.Divide the dough into 3-tablespoon sized balls using a large cookie scoop and drop onto prepared baking sheets.<br>
    10.Bake for 11-13 minutes, or until golden brown.<br>
    11.Cool for 5 minutes before removing to wire racks to cool completely.<br>
    12.Enjoy your delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies!<br>
